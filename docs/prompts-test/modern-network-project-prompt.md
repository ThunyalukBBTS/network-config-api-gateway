In Modern Network I have project "Network API Gateway"

# Project detail
```
Project 13: Network API Gateway
Duration: 2-3 weeks
Summary
Expose network operations via REST APIs.
Programmability Focus
• API abstraction
• Northbound APIs
Core Tasks
• REST → gNMI translation
• Authentication
Deliverables
• API service
• Swagger docs
```

# Notes
High-Level Architecture
- Northbound: Elysia + Postgresql + JWT Auth + Swagger Docs
- Gateway: Elysia (Yang model from) send gNMI/netconf to router IP
- Southbound: Cisco ISR4321 
- (Optional): Frontend Svelte to basic show interface and config (Phase 2)

# API Features
- POST Login: receive username, password return beareer token
- POST Logout: receive beareer token 
- GET Interfaces config, Routes, 
- POST Interface settings: IP, Route, Firewall (json body)

# Ports
